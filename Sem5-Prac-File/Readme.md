This part of the repo contains the programs that I'll be implementing during my 5th semester as a part of GGSIPU's course-work.

I've implemented the following programs until now:

1. [To find the factorial of a number](https://github.com/PRUBHTEJ/Java-Codes/blob/master/Sem5-Prac-File/To%20find%20out%20the%20factorial%20of%20a%20user%20entered%20number)
