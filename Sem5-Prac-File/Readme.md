# 5th Semester Java practical file

This part of the repo contains the programs that I'll be implementing during my 5th semester as a part of GGSIPU's course-work.

I've implemented the following programs until now:

1. [To find the factorial of a number](https://github.com/PRUBHTEJ/Java-Codes/blob/master/Sem5-Prac-File/To%20find%20out%20the%20factorial%20of%20a%20user%20entered%20number)

2. [To print the prime numbers till the nth term](https://github.com/PRUBHTEJ/Java-Codes/blob/master/Sem5-Prac-File/To%20print%20prime%20numbers%20till%20%22n%22)

3. [To print the fibonacci series till the nth term](https://github.com/PRUBHTEJ/Java-Codes/blob/master/Basics/Fibonaacci-series)

4. [To find the avg. marks of "n" students, calculate their percentages & assign each one of them a grade]()
